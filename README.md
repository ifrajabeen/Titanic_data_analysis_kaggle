# Titanic Data Analysis 🛳️

This project explores the famous **Titanic dataset** to uncover insights about the passengers and to understand the factors that contributed to survival rates using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

---

## 📌 Objective

The main goal is to:
- Analyze passenger demographics and ticket information.
- Visualize survival distributions across different categories.
- Derive meaningful patterns using Python libraries.

---

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset used is the Titanic passenger dataset, originally provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). It includes features such as:

- **PassengerId** — ID given to each passenger
- **Survived** — Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass** — Passenger class (1 = Upper, 2 = Middle, 3 = Lower)
- **Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked** — Additional details

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Checked for null values and handled missing data.
   - Converted data types where necessary.
   - Dropped/filled irrelevant or sparse columns.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution analysis for `Age`, `Fare`, and `Pclass`.
   - Count plots and bar graphs for categorical features like `Sex`, `Embarked`, `Survived`.
   - Correlation heatmap to detect strong features influencing survival.

3. **Visualization Tools**
   - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` were used extensively for plotting histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Women and children had a higher survival rate** compared to men.
- **First-class passengers** were more likely to survive.
- People who **embarked from Cherbourg** had a relatively higher survival rate.
- Age and Fare showed visible trends, with younger and high-paying passengers surviving more.
